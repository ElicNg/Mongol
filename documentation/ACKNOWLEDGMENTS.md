ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

Early in development, the git commit authoring wasn't working properly so the contributors section on GitHub does not accurately display the work that was performed. So first up, I'd like to thank Krawalii for finding and implementing clever ways to detect collections automatically. I'd also like to thank BrentAbrahams for polishing up the Method functions and implementing inline editing for JSON.
